• Developed three deep learning models (CNN, VGG16, DenseNet121) using TensorFlow and Keras for plant disease
classification, achieving up to 95% accuracy.

• Implemented transfer learning with pre-trained VGG16 and DenseNet121 models for classification.

• Applied data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flipping) using ImageDataGenerator and regularization techniques (L2
regularization, Dropout) to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.

• Utilized early stopping and model checkpointing with Keras callbacks to optimize training efficiency and
automatically save the best-performing model.

• Deployed a predictive system for real-time plant disease classification.

• Technologies Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.
